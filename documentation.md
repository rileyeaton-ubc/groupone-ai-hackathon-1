# Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Statement

- **Problem Statement**: Describe the primary problem or challenge that the project aims to address.
  - New programmers when entering the industry may suffer from difficulty of using unix commands and implementing them.
- **Objectives**: List the key objectives of the project.
  - To make usage of unix commands easier.
  - To make unix commands possible to understand them better.
- **Target Audience**: Define who the intended beneficiaries or users are.
  - New programmers that are new to programming.
  - People looking to make usage of unix commands easier.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

- **Solution Overview**: A unix shell written in C that has all the features of a standard unix shell, but augmented with generative AI to assist the user in learning how to use the commands effectively.
- **Key Features**:

  - User has the ability to use the interactive shell just like they would a normal unix shell, as all the commands will be available
  - When a user enters a command thats incorrect (i.e. results in an error), generative AI will summarize the error message and provide helpful tips to remedy
  - User can prompt the shell with questions to find the command they're looking for if they're unaware of the exact syntax, and the integrated generative AI will provide them some recommendations
  - When a user enters a command that does not exist, the shell will automatically provide them some similar commands using generative AI

- **Expected Impact**:
  - Will create a lower barrier to entry for those learning the unix shell and its many commands
  - Students who are new to Computer Science will be able learn essential commands quicker, leading to better academic results
  - Those who have no computer science knowledge will be able to use their computers with greater efficiency using the terminal/shell

### 1.3 Technical Aspects - TODO

- **Programming Languages**: List all programming languages used in the project, detailing their roles and why they were chosen (e.g., Python for data analysis, JavaScript for front-end development).
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Specify the frameworks and libraries employed (e.g., TensorFlow, React, Django).

## 2. Documentation of AI Tools Used

### 2.1 Overview of AI Tools - TODO

- **Tool Name**: List each AI tool used (e.g., ChatGPT, CodeWhisperer): ChatGPT, CodeWhisperer, Llama.
- **Purpose**: Describe the purpose of each tool in the context of the project.

### 2.2 Application of AI Tools - TODO

- **When Applied**: Specify when each tool was applied during the project phases (e.g., brainstorming, developing)
  - That was come.
- **How Applied**: Detail the methods or processes through which the AI tool was utilized.
- **Rationale**: Explain why each tool was selected for its specific application.

### 2.3 Total use of AI Tools - TODO

- **Participan 1-- %usage**: Detail the percentage of AI tool usage by the participant across different project phases, such as brainstorming, development, documentation, and testing. Specify which tools were used most frequently.
- **Participan 2-- %usage**: Detail the percentage of AI tool usage by the participant across different project phases, such as brainstorming, development, documentation, and testing. Specify which tools were used most frequently.
- **Participan 3-- %usage**: Detail the percentage of AI tool usage by the participant across different project phases, such as brainstorming, development, documentation, and testing. Specify which tools were used most frequently.
- **Participan 4-- %usage**: Detail the percentage of AI tool usage by the participant across different project phases, such as brainstorming, development, documentation, and testing. Specify which tools were used most frequently.
- **Participan 5-- %usage**: Detail the percentage of AI tool usage by the participant across different project phases, such as brainstorming, development, documentation, and testing. Specify which tools were used most frequently.
